# Calculate-Location-Pairs

This repository contains a Python module which uses GoogleMaps API to calculate travel time between large input of location pairs given by the user. It was developed by me in early 2017 as an assistive coding project for Professor Pablo Fajgelbaum at UCLA.

There are two excel files in the repository that serve as example input and output from this Python module.
